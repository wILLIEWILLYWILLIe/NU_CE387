@W: MT529 :"/home/gel8580/CE387/HW/HW4/edge_detect/sv/fifo.sv":63:4:63:12|Found inferred clock edge_detect_top|clock which controls 351 sequential elements including fifo_in.empty. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
